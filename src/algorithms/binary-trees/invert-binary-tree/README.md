# Invert Binary Tree  
Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.  
Each `BinaryTree` node has an integer `value`, a `left` child node, and a `right` child node. Children nodes can either be `BinaryTree` nodes themselves or `None`/`null`.  

## Example  
__Sample Input__:  
```
tree =     1 
        /     \
       2       3
     /   \    /  \
    4     5  6    7
   /  \
  8    9
```
__Sample Output__:  
```
           1 
        /     \
       3       2
     /   \    /  \
    7     6  5    4
                /   \
               9     8
```
