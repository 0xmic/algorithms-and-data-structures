# Cycle In Graph
You're given a list of `edges` representing an unweighted, directed graph with at least one node. Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the given graph contains a cycle.  

For the purpose of this question, a cycle is defined as any number of vertices, including just one vertex, that are connected in a closed chain. A cycle can also be defined as a chain of at least one vertex in which the first vertex is the same as the last.  

The given list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of `edges`, where each index `i` in `edges` contains vertex `i`'s outbound edges, in no particular order. Each individual edge is represented by a positive integer that denotes an index (a desination vertex) in the list that this vertex is connected to. Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a particular vertex to its destination, not the other way around (unless the destination vertex itself has an outbound edge to the original vertex).  

Also note that this graph may contain self-loops. A self-loop is an edge that has the same destination and origin; in other words, it's an edge that connects a vertex to itself. For the purpose of this question, a self-loop is considered a cycle.

## Example
__Sample Input__:
```
edges = [
    [1, 3],
    [2, 3, 4],
    [0],
    [],
    [2, 5],
    []
]
```
__Sample Output__:
```
true
// There are multiple cycles in this graph:
// 1) 0 -> 2 -> 0
// 2) 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 0
// 3) 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1
// These are just 3 examples; there are more.
```

## Strategy and Complexity
__Strategy__:
* There are multiple ways to solve this problem, and they all make use of a depth-first-search traversal.
* When traversing a graph using depth-first search, a back edge is an edge from a node to one of its ancestors in the depth-first-search tree, and a back edge denotes the presence of a cycle.
* To find back edges, you need to keep track of which nodes you've already visited and which nodes are ancestors of the current node in the depth-first-sesarch tree. There are a few ways to do this, but one approach is to recursively traverse the graph and to keep track of which nodes have been visited in general and which nodes have been visited in the current recursion stack; you can do so with two separate data structures. If you reach a node that has an edge to a ndoe that's already in the recursion stack, then you've detected a back edge, and there's a cycle in the graph.
* You can also detect a back edge by performing a 3-color depth-first search. Each node is colored white to start; recursively traverse the graph, coloring the current node grey and then calling the recursive traversal function on all of its neighbors. After traversing all the neighbors, color the current node black to signify that it's "done". If you ever find an edge to a node that's grey, you've found a black edge, and there's a cycle in the graph.  

__Complexity__: O(v + e) Time | O(v) Space
* v = number of vertices
* e = number of edges
