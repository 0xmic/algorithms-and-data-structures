# Move Element To End  
You're given an array of integers and an integer. Write a function that moves all instances of that integer in the array to the end of the array and returns the array.  
The function should perform this in place (i.e., it should mutate the input array) and doesn't need to maintain the order of the other integers.  

## Example  
__Sample Input__:  
```
array = [2, 1, 2,, 2, 2, 3, 4, 2]  
toMove = 2  
```
__Sample Output__:  
```
[1, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] // the numbers 1, 3, and 4 could be ordered differently  
```
